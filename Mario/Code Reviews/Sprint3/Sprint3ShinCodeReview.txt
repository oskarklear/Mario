Comments:
- Collision with Mario puts the mushroom at the corner of the map. This may lead to errors in the future,
and may not applicable for future games that do not keep the whole map in memory
- Fair amount of cyclomatic complexity: Lots of if-else statements
- Use of the collisionHelper methods is good. Those have lots of reusability. 

Minutes taken: 5
Hypothetical change: Completely remove the Red Mushroom object from the game when it collides with Mario.
