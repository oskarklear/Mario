Comments:

-In the Update method, there are some pretty arbitrary numbers for moving the position in the X and Y directions, and 
 there is an arbitrary number in the if statement with the absolute value function.

-The formatting for the if-else could be more consistent.

Hypothetically we could not use arbitrary numbers. The current implementation could support this change by defining the
numbers before they are used. The count variable seems like it could be made to just be incremented as 1, which would
make more sense and seem less arbitrary.
