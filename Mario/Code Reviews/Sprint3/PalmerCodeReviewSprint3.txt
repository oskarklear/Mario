Specific Comments:
lots of magic numbers make it hard to understand whats going on,
and there are also a lot of long functions with lots of nested if statements.
It would be pretty hard to debug this function if things went wrong.

code review time: 15 minutes
A hypothetical change to the game that could impact this file would be making the koopa collide with goombas and turn around.
The current implementation could handle this, by changing the if statements in collision to include goombas or other koopas as things
that they collide with, which would be pretty simple.
