Sprint 1
File being reviewed: KeyboardInput.cs
File author: Dan Jones
Code quality:
- Instantiated lots of command objects for blocks
- Missing a few comments
- Clean/Precise design. Not messy.

Time spent: 15 minutes

Hypothetical change: Better documentation for what each key does. Should be fairly easy to add a more detailed comment for each key.
