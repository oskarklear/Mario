Comments:
- Methods are potentially doubled. Using a boolean for "facing" could halve the number of methods, consider changing in the future to simplify the code.
- IdleX and IdleY decelerate have a conditional that may not be necessary, look at it next time and see if we really need it
- Overall, not too messy and functionally sound. 

Time taken to complete review: 15 minutes
Hypothetical change: Maybe make the velocity constants parameters to increase future usability.
