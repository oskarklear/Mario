Comments:
- Methods are potentially doubled. Using a boolean for "facing" could halve the number of methods, consider changing in the future to simplify the code.
- Maybe make the velocity variables parameters to allow for more reusablility.
- IdleX and IdleY decelerate have a conditional that may not be necessary, look at it next time and see if we really need it
