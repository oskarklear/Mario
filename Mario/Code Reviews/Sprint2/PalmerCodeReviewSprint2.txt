Specific comments on code quality:The code isn't well commented, and isn't self explanatory as to why it does
what it does. If there are problems in it, it would be pretty difficult to figure out what is wrong. The methods
in the file are useful in their purpose, and make the collision detection system much simpler as a result.
Number of minutes to complete the review: 10 minutes
Hypothetical change: If we were to add more different objects that are involved in collision, this file would
be helpful in making adding those objects easier to do.
