Comments:

-In the Collision method, there seems to be some arbitrary numbers, such as on lines 358, 368, 379, and 381.

-There could be some line spaces added between some of the if statements to make it cleaner.

Minute taken: 15 minutes

Hypothetically there could be a way to not use some arbitrary numbers. The current implementation could support
this change by defining the numbers before they are used, or find some kind of way to avoid using them all together.
