ActivateIdle.cs

- Overall very cluttered, and a separate class seems unnecessary.
- Could be reworked to all occur within KeyboardInput, rather than having a separate class. 
- Could be reworked to reduce the number of if blocks, maybe a switch block?

- I would rework the code to effectively eliminate the class, and migrate the logic into KeyboardInput. A way to send an idle/discontinue command could be done there.
