Dan Jones -- Code review

Author of Code:  
Date: 10/12/2021
Sprint: 2
File name: CollisionHelper.cs
Author: Bennett Palmer

Quality: 

 - Sloppy, seemingly out of order code
 - Collision code seems to be copy pasted in each objects 
 - Magic numbers
 
 - I would adjust the collision code to make it more extensible and modular to reduce reused code

Mins taken: ~20 minutes
