Quality: 

I think this code is pretty great as it does 
what it needs to do. One thing I noticed was the
four chonky if blocks of repeated code. 


Possible change: 

Perhaps a list of the gamepad states and just iterate
over all the gamepad states in a for loop, rather than 
having four nearly identical blocks of code.
