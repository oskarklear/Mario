Comments:

"public MarioContext context { get; set; }"
	- context should be capitalized because it is a property.

"public bool animated { get; set; }"
	- animated should be capitalized because it is a property.

"ContentManager Content;"
	- Content should not be capitalized because it is a standard variable.

"Dictionary<string, Texture2D> sprites;"
	- sprites is not used so it should be deleted.

- The switches in the Update() method look very clean, much better than using excessive if-else statements. Code only loads textures
  as they are needed rather than all at once upon game startup, which is good.

- The use of a common method for all animated sprites in the Draw method is clean. This will rely on all sprite sheets for animated 
  sprites being consistent in their spaces.

Minutes taken: 20 minutes

Hypothetically there may be a way to cut down on the three switches used to load the Mario textures. A lot of the case have in common
the number of columns needed for animation and the animated boolean, which makes it theoretically possible to support said change, but
it would still be difficult because of how we use GetActionState as strings as our means of choosing which textures to load.
