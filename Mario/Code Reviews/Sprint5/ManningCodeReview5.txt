Comments:

- The velocity vector from MarioContext is being directly accessed by GlidingState on line 68, 71, 82, and 85, meaning the vector is a public variable. This should
  probably be made into a private variable and then have a get method to get the value and modify it.

- The idleState and fallingState MarioActionState variables from MarioContext are being directly accessed by GlidingState on lines 35, 67, 81, 114, and 117, meaning
  variables are public. These should probably be made into private variables and then have get methods to get them.

- The JumpingTransition and FallingTransition methods don't have a "Does nothing" comment like the rest of the methods that are not needed for Gliding State. This 
  isn't a huge deal, but for the sake of consistency they should either all have a comment of some sort or none should.

Hypothetically we could refactor our code such that we don't set various variables as public when they don't have a need to be. This is a bad coding practice and
is widespread throughout our code base and not isolated to this instance here. Our current implementation of GlidingState could support changing these to private
inside MarioContext and rather than calling the variables directly, GlidingContext could call the getter methods.
