Comments:
- Parameters removed for  method - less coupling
- More magic numbers
- Medium cyclomatic complexity for new methods
- Methods are generally becoming more messy

Minutes taken: 5

Hypothetical Change: Use more constants to reduce magic numbers. Maybe create more methods tailored
toward specific states, such as an AccelerateUpCape() method as well as an AccelerateUpBalloon()method.
