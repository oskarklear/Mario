Reviewing Parakoopa.cs
Author:Matt Manning
Code Quality comments:
Some magic numbers and unhelpfully named variables, such as counter. Otherwise, It is a pretty
simple and well designed file.
Time taken to complete code review:10 minutes.
A possible future change could be adding unique flight patterns to the parakoopas, rather than simply moving up and down.
the code could incorporate this by using more detailed behavior depending on specific value ranges of the counter.
