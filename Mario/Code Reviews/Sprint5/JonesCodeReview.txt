Authors: Kyle Shin, Bennett Palmer, Dan Jones 

(I couldn't think of anything else to review for this sprint)

Comments: 

- The addition of context.IsBallooned is a pretty gross way to accomplish the PBalloon behavior. We have a
	tendency to rely on public variables rather than using proper design patterns. 

- Relying on context.death.Play(), and any context.* for that matter is bad OOP. We should have really gone back and 
	fixed our disgusting code. 


Mins taken: 10 mins

I would change our code to use getters and setters for isBallooned, and a Play() boolean to set
	so in its update it'll get triggered rather than changing these directly in here. 

If I was more bold, I'd refactor the code completely to have clean seperation of the bahavior and we 
	wouldn't even need getters and setters in here.
