Sprint 4
Class:GoalGate.cs
Class written by:Oskar Klear
Comments on code quality: there were a lot of magic numbers in it, which made it hard to read at times.
For the most part, it was a pretty simple class. The ranges of the gate that give different points are
all hard coded magic numbers, which might make it more tedious to alter the amount of points that are gained than it 
Also, the way the moving part moves up and down isn't entirely obvious.
