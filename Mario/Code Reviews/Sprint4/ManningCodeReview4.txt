Comments:

- In the constructor and in Update(), there are loads of magic numbers. Most of the lines from the constructor and Update() 
  methods are quite literally identical.

- In the constructor, coinSprite is initalized with "Theatre", which is the variable created before the constructor, while Marioicon
  uses "theatre", which is a parameter of the constructor.

- None of the variables created before the constructor are in the proper naming convention except coinSprite. They should be in camel case.

Minute taken: 10 minutes

Hypothetically we could not use arbitrary numbers. We could define the numbers before they are used. We could also maybe hypothetically not
repeat all of the same lines in both the constructor and the Update() method. We could possibly make a function that has all those lines in
it and just call that in the constructor and Update() method.
