- It's an effort to simplify sprites but most sprites don't update the same way which I feel like
	complicates the whole process. Also adding new methods non-standard like gravity, animate, drawsprite, etc
	complicates it more. It caused the most disgusting merge I've ever seen when we finished working on a lot of different sprites.

- Also the Top/Bottom/Left/RightCollide functions calling touchRightOf inside of it is confusing and needlessly
	complex. To me it seems like he got carried away with the simplifications. 

- All that aside, the code looks very clean, low cyclomatic complexity, and not very smelly. I do think some of these
	methods should be consolidated back into their standard functions like Collision

- magic numbers
